KanColleTool
============

KanColleTool is a little tool for KanColle players. Among the features it will have once it's finished are:

* Notifications for things like crafting and repairs completing
* Viewing hidden stats (like condition number)
* Browse the full 'Shipdex', using the game's own data
* English translation of the game using the official client

The tool will support all the three major platforms (Windows, Mac and Linux), and as the author uses them all on a regular basis, you can count on it working well on them all too.

Translations will be provided by using the official client through a proxy, which intercepts data between the game and the server, and changes the content.

**Please, don't be tempted to use the API docs and/or intercepting proxy to cheat.**  
Given what I've seen of the API, it's probably possible. However, once the staff catches wind of it, they will not only permaban you from the game, they will likely change their API, thus sending us back to square one, quite possibly implementing signing of responses and even IP blocks. We don't know until it happens, please don't be the one to make it happen.  
**tl;dr: you'd ruin the game for yourself and others.**
