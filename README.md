KanColleTool
============

KanColleTool is a tool for KanColle players.
That may have been the most redundant sentence I've ever written.

KanColleTool consists of two parts, the Tool (KCT) and the Viewer (KCTV). The Tool displays information gathered from the game, while the viewer is a wrapper around the game to let it and the Tool work more smoothly.

Its features include:

* On-the-fly translation of the game, by modifying server response text
* Viewing hidden statistics, such as Condition
* Notifications for quests, repairs and construction
* Optional spoilers for constructions

If you think of anything I should include, please tell me; either open an [issue](http://github.com/KanColleTool/KanColleTool/issues/), mention [@uppfinnarn](http://twitter.com/uppfinnarn), or send an email to [kctool@sauyon.com](mailto:kctool@sauyon.com).

This tool is entirely separate from @Grabacr07's [KanColleViewer](https://github.com/Grabacr07/KanColleViewer). I didn't even know of their project when I started mine, and all of my work has been separate from theirs.
