Thank you for downloading KanColleTool.

Note that you need a compatible Flash Player installed before the viewer will work.

Chrome has its own embedded Flash Player, which can't be used by other programs;
You need the standalone version, the same one used by Firefox and others.

You can download the latest version at:
